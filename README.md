# Systems-Programming
Coding assignments I did for Systems Programming in C


##**PA1 -- mymalloc**\
Implementing my own version of malloc and free. Open file for further details.\
*Things I could have done better*: The metanode was 24 bytes which takes up a lot of space. I could have comfortably brought down the metanode size without changing the code up too much to 10 bytes which is half the length of the original I attached. I could change trackfree to a char instead of an int and remove the prev pointer and just have a trailing pointer within my code. \
